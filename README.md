# webRTC Signaling Server

This is a minimalistic signaling server for webRTC using socket.IO.

## Getting Started

Make sure to have node v12 or later install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The server is now open on localhost:8000. You can now use the sever to connect with socket-io client and handle the signaling.
